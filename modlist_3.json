Serena's V8\n- Improved compatibility with the RUNDENautomatic mod - allows motors to have multiple gears when car is automatic.\n- Gave more juice to BUS (400%), IFA (400%) and Fury (150%), but also more heat gain - it's still quite unbalanced and needs more tweaking\n- Removed unnecessary shameful code left over from weeks of debugging\n\n* tip: To go forwards in automatic, first set gear lever to R position, reach ~20km/h in reverse and start mashing gears all the way from P to 1 and back few times, until it locks into 1, then choose D and accelerate.

Newly spawned Dacias and Dacia Kombis such as starting car, ai cars, and spawner cars might have the wrong trunk attached. It should be fixed by saving and loading. Naturally spawning cars shouldn't do this.\n2. License plate will rotate downward when reloaded. You can unattach it and reattach it to correct it.\n3. The car will sometimes clip into the ground and suddenly stop, registering as a crash. The normal Dacia does this and is a problem with the base game. The Dacia Kombi has some steps done to mitigate this but it will still happen on rough terrain.\n4. Baskets and possibly other things attached to the back seat will coerge towards the middle of the seat. This is a byproduct of the seat being removeable.",
